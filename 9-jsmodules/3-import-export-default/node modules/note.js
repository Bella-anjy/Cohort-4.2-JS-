/**
 * ES6 (ES2015) introduced a more flexible, easier syntax to export modules:
 * 1. default exports use export default to export JavaScript objects,
 * functions, and primitive data types.
 * 2. 'named exports' use the 'export' keyword to export data in variables.
 * 3. 'named exports' can be aliased with the 'as' keyword.
 * 4. 'import' is a keyword that imports any object, function, or data type.

 * To generate package.json
 * we run `npm init` or `npm init -y` to skip some questions

 * Two types of dependencies
 * 1. dependencies
 * 2. Devdependencies
